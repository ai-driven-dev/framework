# Architecture

Where a capability belongs.

Terms: [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md).

## Anatomy of a plugin

Only the manifest and the skills are required.

| Component | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Manifest | `.claude-plugin/`, holding `plugin.json` |
| Skill | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Actions | `skills/<name>/actions/` |
| Assets | `skills/<name>/assets/` |
| References | `skills/<name>/references/` |
| Agents | `agents/` |
| Commands | `commands/` |
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json` and its scripts |
| MCP configuration | `.mcp.json` |
| Documentation | `README.md`, `CATALOG.md` (generated), `CHANGELOG.md` |

Project rules live in your tool's rules directory, such as `.claude/rules/`.

`aidd-context` generates them.

## Who owns what

Put each capability in the plugin that owns its concern.

Every other plugin delegates to it.

| Plugin | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `aidd-context` | Project knowledge: memory, context files, generators |
| `aidd-pm` | Product management: briefs, epics, stories, specs |
| `aidd-refine` | Thinking about the work: brainstorm, challenge, fact-check |
| `aidd-dev` | Code: plan, build, validate, review, debug |
| `aidd-vcs` | Version control: commits, pull requests, tags |
| `aidd-orchestrator` | Running other skills end to end |
| `aidd-ui` | UI and UX design |
| `aidd-qa` | Acceptance QA with video evidence |
| `aidd-telemetry` | Token measurement |

## How a skill runs

```

| Role | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Skill | Runs in the caller's context. Holds no logic, only its actions. |
| Caller | The session or skill that delegates. Owns scope, integration and acceptance. |
| Orchestrator | Sequences capabilities for the caller. |
| Subagent | Takes a scoped brief and returns only a result to the caller. Never calls an orchestrator. |
| Delegation | At most two layers, no cycles. |

## Rules that keep plugins independent

1. A skill links only inside its own directory.
2. A bundled script is named in backticks, never linked.
3. Address another plugin as `/plugin:folder` only in dispatch tables and orchestration references.
4. Find a provider in another plugin by its description.
5. Keep a bundled script's tests in `scripts/__tests__/`, never in the plugin.
6. Write only what the target tool supports.
7. Delegate agent work by responsibility, never by agent name.
