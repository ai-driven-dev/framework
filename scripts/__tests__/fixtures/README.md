# Fixtures: recorded hook payloads

One real, captured `SessionStart` hook payload per host: `claude-code-session-start.json`,
`codex-session-start.json`, `copilot-session-start.json`, `cursor-session-start.json`.
Captured by the `out-*-skill` probe runs referenced in issue #663's 2026-08-20 comment.

Four real, captured Claude Code `PostToolUse` payloads, one per observed tool:
`claude-code-post-tool-use-write.json`, `-edit.json`, `-notebook-edit.json` (the three tools
that write; `Write`/`Edit` carry `tool_input.file_path`, `NotebookEdit` carries
`tool_input.notebook_path` instead), and `-bash.json` (a non-write tool, captured to prove the
tool-name whitelist actually rejects something rather than never being exercised). Captured by
the `out-cc-skill` probe run.

Two real, captured `PostToolUse` payloads for the path-family extractor, captured while a
skill's own `SKILL.md` was read mid-session — the shape the path-family extractor needs, not
a schema:

- `codex-post-tool-use.json` — captured by `out-codex-skill`. `tool_name` is `Bash` (Codex's
  hook names every shell-backed tool `Bash`, not the `exec_command` its own transcripts
  record — see plan.md); the `SKILL.md` path lives inside `tool_input.command`, not a
  dedicated field.
- `cursor-post-tool-use.json` — captured by `out-cursor-skill`. `tool_name` is `Read`; the
  `SKILL.md` path lives in `tool_input.file_path`.

## The four step-opening payloads

One per host, each the call that opens a step. Two families, and the fixtures are what prove
the split is real rather than a tidy story:

- `claude-code-post-tool-use-skill.json` — `tool_name` is `Skill`, the name sits in
  `tool_input.skill`, and the payload carries `prompt_id`: the same value the CLI sink stores
  as its turn key, which is why a step joins to its cost by identifier here and by ordering
  elsewhere.
- `copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json` — `toolName` is `skill`, and `toolArgs` is a **JSON
  string**, not an object. It has to be parsed. No turn identifier reaches a Copilot hook.
- `codex-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` — no skill is named anywhere. Only a relative
  `SKILL.md` path inside `tool_input.command`, on a tool the hook calls `Bash`.
- `cursor-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` — no skill is named either. An absolute `SKILL.md`
  path in `tool_input.file_path`, with the turn identifier spelled `generation_id`.

A fifth belongs to this set: `copilot-compat-post-tool-use-skill.json`, Copilot's second
payload shape invoking a skill. See "Copilot's second shape, invoking a skill" below —
kept out of this list because it is a second shape for a host already listed here, not a
fifth host.

These are recordings, not hand-written examples — a hand-written fixture would encode the
assumption being tested rather than what a host actually sends.

## The task-declaration payloads

`plugins/aidd-telemetry/hooks/lib/task-declared.cjs`'s reader asks nothing of a host beyond
what calling a tool already requires: any tool call whose own arguments name a file under an
`aidd_docs/tasks/<YYYY_MM>/…` folder is read as that session declaring the task, regardless
of tool name or event. Before this set, that reader was tested only against hand-written
payloads (see `aidd-telemetry-journal.test.js`'s prior `readTaskPayload()`), which proves the
reader agrees with itself, not with anything a host actually sends.

`claude-code-task-declared.json`, `copilot-task-declared.json`, `cursor-task-declared.json`
and `codex-task-declared.json` are real, live captures — 2026-08-31, each host's own current
plugin installed through `aidd setup --ai <host> --plugins aidd-telemetry` in a throwaway
project, asked to read a file inside a task folder. Captured by temporarily replacing the
installed `journal.cjs` entry point with a wrapper that tees its raw stdin to a file and
then execs the real script unchanged. `opencode-task-declared.json` is real too, from the
same date, captured a different way - OpenCode's plugin surface hands its hook a JS event
object in-process rather than stdin, so this one is built by `hooks/opencode-plugin.js`
itself from a genuinely captured event; see "OpenCode's plugin events" below. In every
case the project, the tool session and the wrapper (where one was used) are
all thrown away afterward; nothing in this repository or in any global tool config was
touched to take them.

- **`claude-code-task-declared.json`** — a `Read` tool call; the path lives in
  `tool_input.file_path`, the same field `claude-code-post-tool-use-write.json` above
  carries for a write.
- **`copilot-task-declared.json`** — this capture landed on Copilot's **compat** shape
  (`session_id`/`hook_event_name`/`timestamp`, see "Copilot's second shape" below), not the
  canonical one `copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json` above shows. Expected, not measured as a
  universal fact: this plugin's own `hooks.json` declares PascalCase event keys, and per
  "Copilot's second shape" below that is exactly what selects the compat builder — so a
  capture against the currently-shipped plugin lands here. The path lives in
  `tool_input.path` — a key neither `copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json` (`toolArgs`, a
  string) nor `copilot-compat-post-tool-use-skill.json` (`tool_input.skill`) had shown
  before. The reader finds it regardless of the key name: it scans every string value
  `tool_input` carries, never one named field. The canonical shape's `toolArgs`-as-string
  form is not re-proven by this set; see "What this set does not re-prove" below.
- **`cursor-task-declared.json`** — a `Read` tool call, `tool_input.file_path`, structurally
  identical to `cursor-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` above but pointed at a task folder
  instead of a `SKILL.md`.
- **`codex-task-declared.json`** — a `Bash` tool call (Codex has no distinct "Read" tool
  either; a shell command is the only shape a file read ever takes, exactly as
  `codex-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` above already shows), `tool_input.command` in the
  same `sed -n '1,120p' <path>` form. **Codex is now runnable in the environment this set
  was captured in** (`codex-cli 0.151.0`) — this replaces what was, before 2026-08-31, a
  derivation from `codex-post-tool-use-skill-read.json`'s shape. The genuine capture landed
  on exactly the key set the derivation had already guessed: `session_id`, `turn_id`,
  `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `model`, `permission_mode`, `tool_name`,
  `tool_input.command`, `tool_response`, `tool_use_id`. Codex gates hooks on trust — a
  headless `codex exec` run needs `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, or the hook never fires
  and the run journals nothing; the diagnostic's own untrusted-hook reading
  (`02-diagnose.md`) describes the same failure. One genuine difference the live capture
  surfaced and the old derivation could not have known: `tool_use_id` on a real
  `exec_command` call is shaped `exec-<uuid>`, not the `call_<random>` form the pre-existing
  sibling fixtures above carry. The committed value, `exec-4f8b2e6a-…`, carries that shape
  but is still a synthesised uuid, not the live run's own — every value in this fixture is
  synthesised, per this set's own rule, the shape included. That leaves a real gap:
  inspecting this file alone cannot tell a genuine capture that happened to synthesise this
  shape apart from a careful re-synthesis of the retired derivation that decided to guess it
  too. What actually distinguishes the two is not in the artefact — it is the commit message
  of the change that captured it (`ead9a2f3`, "test: codex's task fixture becomes a genuine
  capture, not a derivation"), which records the live run that produced it: project, host
  and wrapper thrown away afterward, nothing touched in the real `~/.codex`. Naming that gap
  here, rather than letting the file's shape alone imply more evidence than it carries, is
  the same discipline `opencode-session-created.json` is held to below.
- **`opencode-task-declared.json`** — the tool-used call `hooks/opencode-plugin.js` builds
  from a genuinely captured, completed tool part (`opencode-tool-part-completed.json`, see
  "OpenCode's plugin events" below), the path in `tool_input.filePath`. Whether OpenCode
  could declare at all was measured, not assumed: a bounded, three-further-session spike
  (2026-08-31, `opencode 1.14.20`) found that a completed tool part's own arguments do
  reach the plugin's `event` hook. `telemetryTaskAttributable: true` in
  `cli/src/domain/tools/ai/opencode.ts` and `registry-conformance.unit.test.ts` both state
  this now.

The negative case — a captured payload whose path names something other than a task folder
— needs no new capture for four of the five hosts: `claude-code-post-tool-use-skill.json`,
`copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json`, `codex-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` and
`cursor-post-tool-use-skill-read.json` above each name a `SKILL.md` path, and
`declaredTaskPath` returns `null` against all four. OpenCode's own negative,
`opencode-tool-part-no-task.json`, is a fresh capture from the same live run as its positive
sibling — a completed `bash` call, `ls -la`, naming no task folder anywhere in its own
arguments; see "OpenCode's plugin events" below.

**What this set does not re-prove.** `declaredTaskPath` reads `payload.tool_input`, falling
back to `payload.toolArgs` only when `tool_input` is absent — Copilot's canonical builder's
own shape, `toolArgs` as a JSON string, with no `tool_input` field at all
(`copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json` above). Every capture in this set, Copilot's included,
carries `tool_input`, so none exercises that fallback branch end-to-end through a real
payload. It is still tested — `aidd-telemetry-journal.test.js`'s
`"declaredTaskPath reads tool_input first and Copilot's toolArgs string only when
tool_input is absent"` asserts it directly — but against a literal, not a capture, because
it is testing the function's own precedence contract rather than a claim about what a host
sends. That test predates this set and was kept rather than replaced for that reason.

## Copilot's second shape

`copilot-compat-session-start.json`, `copilot-compat-post-tool-use.json`,
`copilot-compat-turn-end.json` — one per event, captured from a real
`@github/copilot@1.0.80` session running the framework's own installed plugin
(issue #681's `Done when`). Where `copilot-session-start.json` and
`copilot-post-tool-use-skill.json` are Copilot's canonical builder (`sessionId`,
`toolName`/`toolArgs` as a JSON string, no `hook_event_name`), these three are its
`_vsCodeCompat` builder: `session_id` and `hook_event_name` spelled Claude Code's way,
`tool_name`/`tool_input` as an object rather than a string, and a `timestamp` field both
shapes carry but no other host does. Which builder a session gets depends on how its
hooks are declared (PascalCase event keys trigger the compat rewrite - see #681's
source-read chain); a real install can produce either, so `detectHost` recognises both.

`lib/step-starts.cjs`'s `STEP_START_BY_HOST.copilot` used to read only the canonical
shape's `toolName`/`toolArgs` - a compat `PostToolUse` never opened a step line, skill or
not. Left unfixed by #681 on purpose: that ticket's own scope was `detectHost` and the
session id it feeds, and closing the gap needed a capture #681 never took - a session that
actually invokes a skill under the compat builder, not just a Bash call.

## Copilot's second shape, invoking a skill

`copilot-compat-post-tool-use-skill.json` — captured 2026-08-22 against a real
`@github/copilot@1.0.80` session, asked by name to run the framework's own installed
`aidd-telemetry` plugin's `00-init` skill (issue #701's `Done when`). The two unknowns
#701 opened on both settle from this one payload: `tool_name` is `skill` - the same
lowercase spelling the canonical builder uses, not Claude Code's `Skill` - and
`tool_input` arrives as an **object** keyed `skill`, matching Claude Code's own
`tool_input.skill` rather than the canonical builder's JSON-string `toolArgs`. Neither
value was guessable from the other two captures: the compat builder mixes one host's
tool-name spelling with another host's argument shape.

`STEP_START_BY_HOST.copilot` now tries both shapes in sequence - the canonical
`toolName`/`toolArgs` reader, then this compat `tool_name`/`tool_input` reader - so a
skill call opens a step line on either payload, and a non-skill call (`Bash`, per
`copilot-compat-post-tool-use.json`) still opens none on the compat shape either.

## Copilot's event log is not a payload capture

Copilot writes `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/events.jsonl`, and each `hook.start` line
carries an `input` object. It is tempting to read that as "the payload the hook received",
which would make capturing a shape free — no session to run, no tokens to spend.

**It is not the same object, and reading it that way produces a fixture of a shape no hook
ever sees.** In `@github/copilot`'s own bundle, the log line is emitted once per *event*,
from a hard-coded literal, before the per-hook payload builder runs. The `preToolUse` site
shows both objects a few statements apart:

```js
// what gets logged
emitHookStart({ hookInvocationId: r, hookType: "preToolUse",
                input: { sessionId, cwd, toolCalls: e.toolCalls.map(...) } })
// what a hook is handed
{ timestamp: Date.now(), cwd: this.workingDir, toolName: u, toolArgs: d }
```

Different keys for the same event, and the hook-facing one carries `timestamp` while the
logged one does not.

The consequence that matters here: **the log always shows the canonical camelCase spelling,
whichever builder the hook actually gets.** The `_vsCodeCompat` rewrite documented above is
selected per hook declaration, after the log line is written.

That is not a hypothetical for this plugin. `plugins/aidd-telemetry/hooks/hooks.json`
declares `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse` and `Stop` — PascalCase, which is exactly what
triggers the rewrite. So **this framework's own hooks receive the compat snake_case payload**
while Copilot's event log records their events in camelCase. Counting spellings in that log
cannot tell the two builders apart, and a count of zero snake_case there is not evidence that
snake_case never arrives. The compat fixtures above are the direct counter-evidence: captured
from a hook's own stdin on 1.0.80, running this plugin, carrying `session_id` and
`hook_event_name`.

Read hook declarations from the plugin, not from whatever else is installed on the machine.
`~/.copilot/hooks/` can hold files belonging to other applications entirely, and their event
casing says nothing about this one.

Read on the readable `@github/copilot` 1.0.57 bundle. The 1.0.80 runtime binary is packed —
`strings` finds no `_vsCodeCompat`, `hookInvocationId` or `hook.start` in it — so the
architecture is proven on 1.0.57 and corroborated on 1.0.80 only by the stdin captures
above. Nothing here settles what 1.0.80 does differently, if anything.

**So a Copilot shape fixture costs a session.** That session was run on 2026-08-28, against
`@github/copilot` 1.0.80, in a throwaway project declaring this plugin's own PascalCase
events with the hook command replaced by one that dumps stdin verbatim. What it settled:

- **All five events arrive in the compat snake_case shape.** `session_id`,
  `hook_event_name`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `initial_prompt`, `stop_reason`. Not one
  camelCase `sessionId` on stdin — the exact opposite of what the event log showed for the
  same events, which is the trap this section exists to name.
- **The three compat fixtures already here are faithful.** Their key sets were compared
  against that stdin and match exactly. That had been assumed since 2026-08-21; it is now
  measured.
- **Two shapes had never been captured**, and are added from this session:
  `copilot-compat-user-prompt-submitted.json` and `copilot-compat-pre-tool-use-skill.json`.
- **`timestamp` is an ISO string on stdin**, where the event log records an integer. One
  more place the two objects differ.
- **The compat builder renames built-in tools to Claude Code's PascalCase spelling but
  leaves `skill` lowercase.** The same session captured `tool_name: "Read"` for a file read
  and `tool_name: "skill"` for the skill call. `STEP_START_BY_HOST.copilot` keys on that
  lowercase spelling, so the asymmetry is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
- **The chain writes.** Those payloads through `journal.cjs` produce `session_start` (with
  `vendor_id` equal to the session id Copilot itself printed), `step_start` naming the
  skill, and `turn_end`.

## Redaction

Every fixture differs from what its probe captured in only two kinds of place:

- `user_email` — replaced with the placeholder `user@example.com` (Cursor only carries this
  field).
- Every absolute path — the real home-directory or scratchpad-tmp prefix replaced with
  `/home/user/probe/...` (or, for a Cursor `transcript_path`, `/home/user/.cursor/...`),
  keeping the path **shape** intact. This includes paths that appear twice inside one
  payload, such as `cursor-post-tool-use.json`'s `tool_input.file_path` and its duplicate
  inside `tool_output`.

Detection reads `cursor_version`, `sessionId` (Copilot's canonical shape) / `session_id`
(every other host, and Copilot's compat shape) plus `timestamp` and `hook_event_name`
together, and the `/projects/` versus `/sessions/` segments of `transcript_path` — none of
which the redaction touches. `copilot-compat-turn-end.json`'s `transcript_path` is redacted
the same way as every other path, with its `.copilot/session-state/` segment kept intact:
that segment is shape, and shape is exactly what proves it matches neither the Codex nor
the Claude Code pattern.

## Hosts declared vs. hosts that currently write

All four hosts are declared in `lib/host.cjs`'s `DECLARED_HOSTS` and `lib/record.cjs`'s per-host
tables — declaring a host's session-id spelling and export-side `vendor_field` is independent
of whether the journal writes for it today:

- **Copilot** writes now, on both shapes. The `hook_event_name`-never-arrives premise above
  was read from a bundle, not a payload (issue #681); a real capture refuted it — the compat
  shape carries `hook_event_name` with Claude Code's own spelling (`SessionStart`,
  `PostToolUse`, `Stop`). What was true, and stays true: neither shape's payload carries an
  event name journal.cjs's own dispatch reads from, since it dispatches from argv (the event
  name `hooks.json` passes on its command line), and every replay in this suite drives that
  argv the same way. `resolveEventName` reading `hook_event_name` is only ever the fallback
  for a payload replayed with no argv at all.
- **Cursor** fires no `Stop`-equivalent hook when run headless (`sessionEnd` arrives instead,
  and is not mapped to `turn-end` — see issue #680); its `SessionStart`-equivalent still
  writes normally. `vendor_field` is `null` for Cursor specifically because its telemetry
  export itself is unmeasured (an Enterprise team setting), not because of either open issue.
  Cursor's own payload carries no `cwd` at all, only `workspace_roots` (a multi-root
  workspace can list several, not all of them git repositories) — `lib/repo.cjs`'s
  `readCwd`/`CWD_READER_BY_HOST` resolves the first entry that actually is one, the same way
  `lib/record.cjs`'s `readSessionId` resolves Cursor's differently-spelled session id.

## OpenCode's plugin events

`opencode-session-idle.json`, `opencode-session-created.json` and the two
`opencode-tool-part-*.json` fixtures are not hook payloads — OpenCode's plugin surface
hands `hooks/opencode-plugin.js` a JS event object in-process, never a stdin JSON payload
the way every other host's hook does. They carry different weight.

- **`opencode-session-idle.json`** is a real, live capture: `opencode 1.14.20` running
  `opencode run` (`opencode/big-pickle`), 2026-08-31. `sessionID` is the only field the
  event carries, matching `@opencode-ai/sdk`'s own `EventSessionIdle` type exactly — it
  names the session, and nothing about where it ran. Synthesised: `sessionID`'s value only.
- **`opencode-session-created.json`** is *not* a delivery capture, and this entry is
  the only place that gap is stated for it as bluntly as it needs to be: **`session.created`
  was never observed reaching the plugin's own `event` hook.** One live `opencode 1.14.20`
  run (`opencode run`, `opencode/big-pickle`, 2026-08-31, started with `--print-logs`) is the
  measurement this rests on: the plugin's `event` hook demonstrably fired for roughly 38
  events of other types in that run (`session.updated`, `session.status`, `message.updated`
  and others, written to a real `captured-events.jsonl`), the run's own log shows
  `service=plugin path=…capture.js loading` followed later by
  `service=bus type=session.created publishing`, and `session.created` never appears among
  the captured events despite that publish line. That is the discriminating run - it is the
  only one with debug logging turned on, so it is the only one that can distinguish
  "never published" from "published but not delivered."

  Two further attempts neither confirm nor refute it, and are named here only so the count
  is not inflated: a second `opencode run` without `--print-logs` also captured no
  `session.created`, but with no log to show whether one was ever published, so it adds
  nothing beyond the first; a bare `POST /session` API call captured zero plugin events of
  any type in that run, so it says nothing about `session.created` specifically. This is not
  a new defect - the plugin README already named it (`README.md`, "OpenCode misses a server
  process's first session, and `opencode run` is always a first session") - this capture is
  the first evidence behind that sentence rather than a doc comment asserting it.

  The fixture's shape rests on two things that *are* verified: `@opencode-ai/sdk@` (the
  version opencode 1.14.20 ships) declares `EventSessionCreated` as
  `{ type: "session.created", properties: { info: Session } }` - byte-identical to
  `EventSessionUpdated`'s own declared shape - and a `session.updated` event *was* captured
  live in the same run, carrying a real `info` object with this exact key set (`id`, `slug`,
  `projectID`, `directory`, `title`, `version`, `permission`, `time.created`,
  `time.updated`). The fixture is that real `info` shape, re-wrapped under the type the SDK
  declares for creation. Every value in it is synthesised. Treat it as a shape derived from
  a verified type declaration plus a genuine sibling capture, not as a recording of
  `session.created` actually arriving - because it never did.

## OpenCode's tool part

Whether a tool call's own arguments ever reach the plugin's `event` hook was an open
question this deliverable exists to close, bounded before it started: three further
sessions, varying the model, then stop - see plan.md's own Decisions row for why. The
question was settled on the **first** of those three, not the last: `opencode 1.14.20`,
2026-08-31, model `opencode/ling-3.0-flash-fin-free`, prompted to list this directory's own
files. The model called its own `read` tool, and the plugin's `event` hook received a
`message.part.updated` event whose `part.type` was `"tool"` - three times, once per state
transition (`pending`, `running`, `completed`).

This directly contradicts an earlier reading this deliverable's own spec.md carried in:
three *prior* sessions, model `opencode/big-pickle`, answered every prompt in text,
including one that asked for a tool call, and produced no tool part. Read the two together
and the earlier negative was never a property of
OpenCode's plugin surface - it was `big-pickle` declining to call a tool. `ling` did, on the
very same prompt shape, in the very same plugin. **Measured-and-not-observed on one model
is not evidence a tool part is undeliverable on the host** - the same distinction
`session.created` above exists to keep honest, now cutting the other way: this earlier
negative reading undersold what the plugin surface can actually deliver.

Two further attempts, both spent getting the completed part's own full shape rather than
searching for whether one existed at all (already settled): a second `ling` run, same
prompt, full-object logging - reproduced the tool part in ~6 seconds, this time with every
field. A third session was not needed once the second reproduced cleanly, so the count
stands at two of the three further sessions the bound allowed, one held in reserve.

- **`opencode-tool-part-completed.json`** — the completed `read` call from that second run:
  `part.type: "tool"`, `part.tool: "read"`, `part.state.input.filePath` an absolute path,
  `part.state.output` the file's own content. Redirected at a task-folder path for this
  fixture, the same convention every `*-task-declared.json` capture uses. Every id
  synthesised; the key set is exactly what arrived.
- **`opencode-tool-part-no-task.json`** — the negative, from the same run: a completed
  `bash` call, `part.state.input.command: "ls -la"`, naming no task folder anywhere in its
  own arguments.

`hooks/opencode-plugin.js`'s `declaredTaskCallFor` reads only a **completed** tool part -
`pending` carries `state.input: {}`, empty and unsearchable, and reading `running` too would
call the declaration reader twice for the one real call `completed` already catches. Neither
fixture stands for `pending`/`running`; `aidd-telemetry-opencode-payloads.test.js` asserts
those states produce no journal call by mutating the completed fixture's own `state`, since
a genuine capture of an incomplete call carries nothing this reader would ever act on
anyway.
