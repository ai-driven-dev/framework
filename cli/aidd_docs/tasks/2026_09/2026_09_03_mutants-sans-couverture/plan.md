# Plan: Cover what no test executes

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Goal** | Turn the measured no-coverage set into tests that pin user-visible behaviour, and refuse the ones that would only move a number |
| **Source** | `reports/mutation/<scope>/mutation.json`, produced by `pnpm test:mutation:<scope>` — the seven committed scopes of `2026_09_03_mutation-scopes` |

## What the measurement says

2 582 mutants across 134 files sit in code no unit or integration test executes. That is not
one problem. Ranked, it is three:

| Where | Mutants | Share of the file | What it is |
| ----- | ------: | ----------------: | ---------- |
| `presentation/commands/*` | 1 069 sur 1 094 | 98 % | mostly commander wiring: `.command()`, `.option()`, `.action()` |
| `presentation/display/*` | 130 | 100 % | pure formatting functions |
| everything else | ~1 470 | 27–92 % | parsing, transforms, orchestration, adapters |

## The decision that shapes this plan

**The command files are not covered here, and the score stays low on purpose** — but the reason
is priority, not impossibility, and the first version of this paragraph overstated it. Most of
that branching is commander's, not ours, and a unit test over it asserts that `.option()` was
called; the repo's test skill forbids the shape it would take ("snapshot tests on menu trees /
output strings"); and what proves those files is the e2e suite and the smoke script, which the
mutation run cannot see — checked on the case most likely to break the argument, the
`doctor --plugin` exit-code gate, which `tests/e2e/command-matrix-plugin.e2e.test.ts` covers
exactly.

The overstatement: not all of it is commander's. `presentation/commands/global-options.ts` is
eighteen lines of pure option reading with four uncovered mutants, one of which flips every
invocation to verbose; `doctor.ts`'s `categoryOf` and `printInventory` are the same shape. Those
are ours and a unit test reaches them. They belong to a later phase, not to the exclusion.

`presentation` scoring 14,08 % stays a known artifact of the measurement's blind spot rather
than a debt — for the command wiring, which is most of it, not for all of it.

Everything else is covered where a regression would be visible to someone using the CLI.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Mutants | File |
| - | ----- | ------: | ---- |
| 1 | The source spellings a user types | 71 | [`phase-1.md`](./phase-1.md) |
| 2 | Copilot's content transforms | 173 | to write after phase 1 is measured |
| 3 | The marketplace sync flow | 100 | idem |
| 4 | What the displays print | 130 | idem |
| 5 | Three adapters — two tested, one deleted | 143 measured (105 estimated) | [`phase-5.md`](./phase-5.md) |

Each phase was written only after the one before it was re-measured. That rule paid twice:
phase 5's estimate of 105 mutants measured 143, and one of its three targets turned out to be
code no caller reaches, where the right answer was deletion rather than tests.

## Decisions

| Decision | Why |
| -------- | --- |
| A test is written only when the regression it prevents can be named | A test written to kill a mutant raises the score and protects nothing. Each phase states what breaks for a user if the behaviour regresses; if that cannot be stated, the test is not written |
| Named by intention, with the functional case inside | `describe` names the thing the user does — the spelling, the flow — and the nested `it` names the observable outcome. Never the function called. Note a conflict this plan does not resolve: `cli/.claude/skills/test` requires the *parent* `describe` to wrap a class (`describe('<ClassName>')`), and only constrains `it` names. The instruction given here overrides that for the `describe` layer; the two documents should be reconciled, and until they are, this is a deliberate divergence rather than a drift |
| Extend the existing test file, do not open a new one | `kernel/source.unit.test.ts` already has the nested shape. A second file for the same unit splits the story of one behaviour across two places |
| Re-measure after each phase, and quote the delta as approximate | Run-to-run noise on a scope is around 0,4 point. A delta quoted to the hundredth claims a precision the instrument does not have |
| The score is never the acceptance criterion | Stated in the project goal: scored, never gating. A phase is done when the named behaviours are pinned, and the score is reported as what it is — a consequence |
