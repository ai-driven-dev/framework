# Instruction: Put three misplaced units where they belong

Three units carry a name from one area and do the work of another. Each was found by following what
they write, not what they are called.

Moving them is what makes `distribution` a leaf: afterwards it knows nothing about tools or about
the installation record.

## Test Scope

```mermaid

title: Test scope
---
journey
  section Setup
    a project with a marketplace and an installed plugin => both states populated: 5: cli
  section Happy path
    run marketplace check => upstream-removed plugins still reported: 5: cli
    run marketplace remove with cleanup => registry entry and orphan files both gone: 5: cli
    run setup => marketplace entries still written into each tool's settings: 5: cli
  section Edge case - a catalog in Copilot's own format
    a .plugin/marketplace.json => list its plugins => parsed as before: 1: cli
  section Teardown
    nothing under the sourcing side imports a tool profile or the manifest => the leaf holds: 5: system
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` Move the translator to the framework side

> Four of its six files import `Manifest` and `Plugin`.

1. It is not translation, it is translation applied at install time and recorded. Move
   `use-cases/plugin/translator/` accordingly.

### `2)` Name the three flows

1. `marketplace-check` diffs catalogs against `manifest.getPlugins(toolId)`.
2. `marketplace-remove` deletes plugin files and calls `manifest.removePlugin` then `save`.
3. `marketplace-sync-settings` writes into each tool's settings file.
4. All three cross two areas. Move them out of `marketplace/` into a `flows/` directory.

### `3)` Move the catalog parser to the sourcing side

1. `copilot-marketplace-catalog.ts` parses a catalog into `PluginCatalog`. Reading a catalog is
   sourcing, not formatting.

## Test acceptance criteria

| Task | Acceptance criteria |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Installing, updating and restoring a plugin behave as before for every tool |
| 2    | `marketplace check`, `marketplace remove --cleanup` and `setup` behave as before |
| 3    | A Copilot-native catalog is still read correctly |
| all  | Nothing left under `marketplace/` imports a tool profile or `Manifest`. Golden and e2e pass **unmodified** |
