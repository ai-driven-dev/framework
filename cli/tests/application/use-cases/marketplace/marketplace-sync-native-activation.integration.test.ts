/**
 * The seam #703 is about, from the writing side.
 *
 * `aidd` declares a plugin in a project's own settings, and the host loads it only once
 * that host's own CLI has registered it — `activateNativeTools` is what performs that
 * second half. Nothing asserted it: `marketplace-sync-settings-use-case.ts` had no test
 * file at all, so the one act that makes a declared plugin actually load was covered
 * nowhere, on the branch that shipped it.
 *
 * The pairing that matters is the ref. This file proves the activation is driven with the
 * same `<plugin>@<marketplace>` string `TelemetryHostRegistrationSetup` looks up, so the
 * two halves cannot drift into disagreeing about what to call one plugin — the failure the
 * diagnostic exists to report would otherwise become a failure it invents.
