/**
 * The one literal this feature spells twice, held to itself across the language boundary.
 *
 * `aidd telemetry on` writes the call site from TypeScript; the hook restores it from
 * zero-dependency CommonJS shipped into a person's repository, and cannot import the CLI's
 * own function — the CLI may not be installed when the hook runs, which is the whole point
 * of the hook needing nothing. So the line exists in two places.
 *
 * This is what stops them drifting, and it is the shape this plugin's other cross-language
 * literal already uses: the real hook module is loaded and asked, and its answer is compared
 * against the real CLI function's — never against a third copy typed into a fixture, which
 * would only prove that the fixture agrees with whoever wrote it last.
 *
 * If they ever diverge, `aidd telemetry on` installs one line and the hook restores a
 * different one, so a repaired repository silently stops trailering while both sides pass
 * their own tests.
