 * the plugin and still declines it.
 *
 * `unanswerable` is its own answer rather than a shade of `not-registered` for the rule
 * this whole layer is built on: an unknown is never a zero. A registry that cannot be read
 * — absent, unreadable, or JSONC where JSON was expected — has said nothing, and printing
 * that as "not registered" would invent a fact. Copilot's own `~/.copilot/config.json`
 * opens with two `//` comment lines, so this is not hypothetical: a naive parse throws on
 * the first registry a reader meets.
 *
 * **A fifth answer was designed and is not built here.** The plan distinguished a plugin
 * the host does not carry from one that never reached the project's own `enabledPlugins`
 * at all, which happens because `mergeEnabledPlugins` skips silently twice. Telling those
 * apart needs the set of declared refs per tool, and `TelemetryEvidenceReader` exposes no
 * accessor for it — `readRecorderDeclaration` looks for the recorder specifically, not for
 * every declared key. Adding one is a port method, an adapter method and their tests, for a
 * distinction between two flavours of the same outcome: the plugin will not load. The
