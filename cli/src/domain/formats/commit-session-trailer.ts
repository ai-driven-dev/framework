/**
 * The one link between a commit and the session that produced it.
 *
 * Every other link in the chain a record can be read along already exists: a request names
 * its turn, a turn names its session, a session names the task folder it declared. What
 * nothing named was the commit — so "this backlog item cost X" could be answered, and "this
 * commit cost X" could not, though the two are one query apart.
 *
 * A commit carries `AIDD-Session-Id: <session anchor>` and the join closes. The value is
 * whatever `session-anchor.ts` resolves — never a second identifier minted for this, which
 * would be a second identity for one thing.
 *
 * **How far that join is measured, by host, because it is not the same distance for both.**
 *
 * On Claude Code it is measured: `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is the transcript filename, and
 * `claude-code-transcript.ts`'s own `matchesMainTranscript` resolves a session by
 * `<sessionId>.jsonl`, so the variable and the record's `vendor_id` are the same string.
 *
 * On Codex it is measured too, on 2026-09-02, against two real sessions:
 *
 *   fresh session    CODEX_THREAD_ID = 01a06041… = session_meta.id = the rollout's filename
 *   resumed session  CODEX_THREAD_ID = 01a06041… — and no second rollout was written at all
 *
 * The resume is the half that mattered. This module used to warn that "a thread spans
 * several rollouts, so a commit made in a later one joins to nothing"; `codex exec resume
 * --last` disproved it, appending to the same rollout file rather than opening a new one.
 * `CODEX_THREAD_ID` tracks the rollout, and the rollout's uuid is exactly the `vendor_id`
 * both the hook and the reader join on. So the trailer's value equals the records' own.
 *
 * What that leaves is narrow, named, and bounded. 89 of the 418 rollouts on the machine this
 * was measured on carry `thread_source: "subagent"`, where `session_meta.id` is the
 * subagent's own and `session_meta.session_id` is the parent's. No capture yet says which of
 * the two a subagent's `CODEX_THREAD_ID` carries, so a commit authored from inside a Codex
 * subagent is the one case not measured.
 *
 * The bound is what makes it liveable rather than open-ended: those two identifiers are the
 * subagent and the thread that delegated to it, so the trailer names one or the other and
 * both are the same piece of work. The failure mode is a commit attributed to the parent
 * thread instead of the delegated turn inside it — coarser than intended, never somebody
 * else's session and never a different tree. And where the named rollout has no records
 * read, the result is the ordinary "a join that finds no records on the other side", which
 * this contract already calls a normal outcome.
 *
 * Settling it takes one Codex session that delegates, with `CODEX_THREAD_ID` read from
 * inside the subagent and compared against the rollout that subagent wrote. Nothing forces a
 * delegation from the command line, so it waits for one that happens anyway rather than for
 * a run bought to provoke it.
 *
 * Every ordinary session, fresh or resumed, joins exactly.

 * can grep. */

 * deciding whether a hook holds anything but ours, and a third spelling there would make a

 * the message file, where the message came from, and the commit being amended — because the
 * delegate reads the first two and a hook that dropped them would trailer a merge.
 *
 * The separators are forced to `/`, which is the whole of what makes this work on Windows.
 * A hook is shell, run by the `sh` Git for Windows ships, and that shell does not resolve
 * `C:\Users\…`: inside double quotes a backslash is an ordinary character, so the path
 * arrives literally and names nothing. `C:/Users/…` it resolves fine. Node's own `resolve`
 * hands back backslashes there, so this is the seam where a filesystem path becomes shell
 * text and has to stop being one. On POSIX the replacement matches nothing and the string is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Both sides go through here — `installCommitMessageDelegate` writes this line and
 * `removeCommitMessageDelegate` looks for it — so the two can never disagree about the
 * spelling, whatever the platform. */

 * A hook that fails is a commit that fails, so every path here ends in `exit 0` — measurement
 * is never allowed to stand between a person and their own commit.
 *
 * `CODEX_THREAD_ID` is read before `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, the same precedence and for the
 * same measured reason as `session-anchor.ts`: a Codex process nested inside a Claude Code
 * session inherits the outer session's variable, and trailering the enclosing session would
 * name work it did not do. Neither variable set means no AI session made this commit, and
 * the commit gets no trailer at all — an unknown is never a guess.
 *
 * A merge or a squash is skipped: neither is a person authoring work, and a merge commit
 * carrying a session id would attribute every commit it brings in to that one session.
