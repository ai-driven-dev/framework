 * a tool nothing here claims to know, and the diagnostic reports it unanswerable rather
 * than assuming it agrees.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-02 on the machine that built this, reading shape only:
 *
 *   Claude Code  ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json   { version, plugins: { ref: [ … ] } }
 *   Codex        ~/.codex/config.toml                       [plugins."ref"] enabled = true
 *   Copilot      ~/.copilot/config.json                     JSONC, { …, installedPlugins: [] }
 *
 * **Copilot's registry was measured on 2026-09-03, and it is not the file this once
 * declined to read.** An earlier version refused Copilot because `~/.copilot/config.json` is
 * JSONC and its `installedPlugins` read empty on a machine that had run installs. The
 * instinct was right and the conclusion was wrong: that array is not the registry, and the
 * registry is `~/.copilot/settings.json`. Driven live under a sandboxed home,
 * `copilot plugin marketplace add <dir>` writes `extraKnownMarketplaces` and
 * `copilot plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>` writes
 * `enabledPlugins: { "<plugin>@<marketplace>": true }` — plain JSON, no comments, and the
 * same key every other host uses. `copilot plugin uninstall` sets that value to `false`
 * rather than deleting the key, so a registered-but-off plugin is an ordinary state here,
 * not a shape only Codex can produce.

 * **Presence is not the whole answer, and an earlier version of this file said it was.**
 * That claim came from reading the first entry of the first key and generalising; read
 * across all 115 entries on the machine measured, they carry a seventh field the first one

 *
 * Ignoring that would report a ref installed for another project as `registered` here, which
 * is the same unmeasured confidence this file refuses to extend to Copilot a few lines up. A
 * ref counts for this project when some entry is user-scoped — machine-wide by construction,
 * and those carry no `projectPath` — or names this project. Claude records no enabled flag
 * anywhere, so a ref that counts maps to `true`.

 * Two defects were found here by running it rather than reading it, and both produced the
 * inversion this whole feature exists to remove: a host that will not load a plugin,
 * reported as one that will.
 *
 * The first took `lines[index + 1]` and called that "absent `enabled` reads as enabled". It
 * meant "not on the immediately following line", so a blank line, a comment, a reordered key
 * or a trailing comment each turned `enabled = false` into an enabled plugin.
 *
 * The second was the fix for the first. Keeping the first occurrence of a ref was justified
 * by "TOML forbids defining a table twice, so a second line that looks like this header is
 * necessarily not one" — which proves one of the two is fake and never which one. A header
 * spelled inside a multi-line string BEFORE the real table therefore won, and a disabled
 * plugin read as registered again, in the mirror image of what last-wins got wrong.
 *
 * Skipping multi-line strings is what makes the ordering rule true rather than asserted: a
 * fake header is not seen at all, so the only header that can be taken is a real one, and
 * TOML's own prohibition then guarantees there is exactly one of those.
 *
 * Absent `enabled` reads as enabled: Codex writes the key on every table it creates, so a
 * table without one is a shape it does not produce, and between "the host listed this
 * plugin" and "the host listed it and said nothing", the listing is the fact.
