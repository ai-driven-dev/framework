/**
 * Shows, then removes, what this tool measured about one person — never both in the same

 *
 * `preview()` alone resolves every location; `remove()` takes exactly the value `preview()`
 * produced and never resolves a location of its own — it calls no path resolver, and it
 * lists no directory. Every name it deletes came from the preview a person already saw.
 * Two computations that happen to agree today (this machine's sink directory, a relocated
 * `AIDD_USER_CONFIG_DIR`, a file that appears between the two calls) can disagree
 * tomorrow, and the failure that produces is deleting something nobody was shown. Passing
 * the preview through, rather than re-deriving inside `remove()`, is what makes that
 * failure inexpressible rather than merely untested — see `telemetry-removal.ts`'s module
 * doc for the same guarantee stated from the value's side.
 *
 * Confirmation is not this use case's concern: whether to call `remove()` at all is the
 * command layer's decision, from `--yes`. A refusal is simply never calling it — never a
 * throw, since a person who looked and decided not to is not an error.
 *
 * The telemetry switch (`.aidd/config.json`) is never touched here — this use case holds
 * no dependency capable of writing it, so that is true by construction, not by care.
