# Instruction: `aidd telemetry check` — the export, the trust, and the join

## Architecture projection

> Tree of the final files. ✅ create · ✏️ modify · ❌ delete
>
> The half that needs a tool's own configuration: whether an export is set up, whether the
> identifier can be joined, and whether the tool trusts this plugin's hooks at all.

## User Journey

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[The local chain reads ok] --> B{Is an export configured?}
  B -- no --> C[Say so; the local route still answers]
  B -- yes --> D{Can the identifier be joined?}
  D -- no --> E[Name the setting that breaks the join]
  D -- yes --> F{Does the tool trust this plugin's hooks?}
  F -- no --> G[Name the trust, never a hook that failed]
  F -- yes --> H[ok, with the figure it rests on]
```

## Test Scope

```mermaid

title: Test scope

journey
  section Setup
    A healthy project whose local claims already read ok => only the export claims remain: 5: system
  section Happy path
    Run aidd telemetry check => ok, naming the figure it rests on, with no claim left unjudged: 5: cli
  section Edge case - no export configured
    Nothing turned the export on => run check => says the export is not configured, not that it failed: 1: cli
  section Edge case - the identifier cannot be joined
    A complete export beside OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID=false => run check => names that exact setting: 1: cli
  section Edge case - an untrusted Codex hook
    A config.toml with no trusted_hash for this plugin => run check => names the trust, not a hook that never fired: 1: cli
  section Edge case - a renamed hook event
    A hook approved under its old event name => run check => reports it untrusted, since approval is per entry: 1: cli
  section Edge case - Codex config absent entirely
    No config.toml at all => run check => falls back to never-fired, never to a guess at trust: 1: cli
  section Teardown
    Remove the temp project => the machine's own tool configuration untouched: 5: system
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` The export configuration, behind a port

1. Port `export-config.cjs` into `export-config-reader-adapter.ts`, keeping the one setting that survives identity resolution.
2. Port `export-sink.cjs` into `export-sink-reader-adapter.ts`.
3. Read Codex's own `[otel]` table when its thread identifier names the session, never Claude's settings files.

### `2)` Hook trust, per entry

1. Port `hook-trust.cjs` into `hook-trust-reader-adapter.ts`.
2. Keep the measured rule: trust is keyed per entry, so a renamed event inherits no approval.
3. An absent configuration falls back to never-fired, never to a guess at trust.

### `3)` Judge the remaining claims

1. Extend the use-case to settle every claim marked unjudged in phase 4.
2. The display stops listing anything as not yet judged, because nothing is.

### `4)` Confront it with a machine's real configuration

> Every fixture in this plan was written against the code that reads it. Only a configuration
> nobody authored for this test can disagree — which is how the Codex over-count surfaced.

1. Run both checkers against the real tool configurations present on the development machine.
2. Record every claim where they differ, and settle each as a defect in one or the other before proceeding.
3. Keep the finding in the phase's own notes; it is evidence, not a test that CI can rerun.

### `5)` Pin the full set, then delete the checker

1. Drive both `telemetry-check.cjs` and `aidd telemetry check` against the same fixtures, covering every claim in the union.
2. Rewrite `02-check`'s `SKILL.md` and both actions to call the CLI.
3. Delete `02-check/scripts/`, its `package.json`, and `scripts/__tests__/telemetry-check.test.js`.

## Test acceptance criteria

| Task | Acceptance criteria                                                                                             |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | An export configured but unjoinable names the exact setting that breaks the join, and Codex's own table is read for a Codex session. |
| 2    | A hook approved under an old event name reports untrusted; an absent configuration reports never-fired.            |
| 3    | No claim is printed as not yet judged, on any fixture.                                                            |
| 4    | Both checkers were run against the machine's real tool configurations, and every divergence is settled and written down.          |
| 5    | For every claim in the union, the CLI's verdict and reason equal the deleted checker's, and `02-check/scripts/` no longer exists. |
