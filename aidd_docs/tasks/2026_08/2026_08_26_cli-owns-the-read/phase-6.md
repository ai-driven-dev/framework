## User Journey

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Person installs the plugin alone] --> B[Their sessions are measured from that moment]
  B --> C[They ask what a week cost]
  C --> D{aidd answers?}
  D -- yes --> E[The answer, covering sessions recorded before the CLI existed]
  D -- no --> F[Stop: the CLI is required to answer, and here is how to install it]
  F --> G[Recording continues untouched, nothing was lost]
```

## Test Scope

```mermaid

title: Test scope

journey
  section Setup
    Install the plugin into a project with no aidd on the PATH => recording works, answering cannot: 5: system
  section Happy path
    Journal a session with the hooks alone => the run file is written without any CLI: 5: system
    Put aidd on the PATH and ask for a report => the answer covers the session recorded without it: 5: cli
  section Edge case - the three skills say the same thing
    Remove aidd from the PATH => ask each of the three skills => all three stop with one wording, not three: 1: cli
  section Edge case - the CLI is absent while recording
    Remove aidd from the PATH => run a session => the journal is still written: 1: system
  section Edge case - the promise is stale
    Read every doc that mentions the plugin => none claims the CLI is unnecessary to answer: 1: system
  section Edge case - Windows resolution
    Run a skill's own command on windows-latest => the CLI resolves on the PATH there too: 1: cli
  section Teardown
    Restore the PATH => the machine's own setup untouched: 5: system
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` Hold the three skills to one wording

> The rule itself was written in phase 1 and reused in phase 3. What is missing is a guard
> that a fourth skill cannot invent a fourth behaviour.

1. Assert the three locating actions carry the same absent-CLI wording, character for character.
2. Assert none of them can reach a report when `aidd` does not answer.

### `2)` Restate the promise per capability

> The README's claim became false in phase 1. This is where it is corrected, once, for every doc.

1. `plugins/aidd-telemetry/README.md`: replace "no npm install, no CLI, no account" with what is
   now true. Not two halves — **three acts, and only the middle one needs nothing**: allowing
   measurement calls `aidd telemetry on`, recording is the hooks under plain `node`, answering
   calls the CLI again. "Measuring needs nothing" reads as though a person can install the
   plugin alone and start; they cannot, because they cannot turn it on. (Landed early, in the
   commit that made the README stop naming deleted scripts — this task now verifies it rather
   than writing it.)
2. `docs/FAQ.md` and `docs/CATALOG.md`: the same split, one line each.
3. Say plainly what is unchanged: nothing leaves the machine, and no amount is computed.

### `3)` Prove recording survives without the CLI

> The whole reason the write path stayed in node.

1. An install with no `aidd` anywhere journals a session end to end.
2. The figures for that session are read later, once the CLI is present, and are complete.

### `4)` Make Windows exercise a skill's own command

> The layer has already paid once for assuming a POSIX rule, when `os.homedir()` turned out never to read `$HOME` there.

1. The `cli / Windows` job runs one command lifted from a skill's markdown, not only the suites.
2. It fails if the CLI cannot be resolved on the PATH there.

## Test acceptance criteria

| Task | Acceptance criteria                                                                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The three skills' absent-CLI wording is identical, and none reaches a report when `aidd` does not answer.                         |
| 2    | No file in the repository claims the plugin answers without the CLI, and every one naming the dependency also says recording does not need it. |
| 3    | A session journalled with no `aidd` present is read completely once the CLI is installed.                                         |
| 4    | `cli / Windows` runs a command lifted from a skill's own markdown, and fails when the CLI cannot be resolved on the PATH.         |
