## User Journey

  A[Person wants their work attributed to them] --> B[aidd telemetry identity status]
  B --> C{Already opted in?}
  C -- no --> D[aidd telemetry identity on]
  D --> E[An identifier is minted in the OS user's own profile]
  E --> F[aidd telemetry identity name 'Baptiste']
  F --> G[Records read from now on carry person_id]
  C -- yes --> G
  G --> H{Changed their mind?}
  H -- yes --> I[aidd telemetry identity off]
  I --> J[New records carry no person at all]
```

## Test Scope

title: Test scope

journey
  section Setup
    Point the OS profile at an empty temp directory => no identity file exists: 5: system
  section Happy path
    Run aidd telemetry identity status => states that no identity is recorded: 5: cli
    Run aidd telemetry identity on => mints an identifier and states where it lives: 5: cli
    Run aidd telemetry identity name "Baptiste" => the display name is stored beside it: 5: cli
    Run aidd telemetry identity status => states the identifier and the name: 5: cli
    Run aidd telemetry identity off => states that new records will carry no person: 5: cli
  section Edge case - opting in twice
    An identity already exists => run identity on => reports the same identifier, never a second one: 1: cli
  section Edge case - naming before opting in
    No identity file => run identity name "X" => refuses and names opting in as the missing step: 1: cli
  section Edge case - the identity file is unreadable
    Replace the file with a directory => run identity status => states it cannot be read, never that none is set: 1: cli
  section Edge case - a repository tries to point at its own identity
    Set AIDD_USER_CONFIG_DIR => run identity status => the OS profile is still what answers: 1: cli
  section Teardown
    Remove the temp profile => the machine's own identity untouched: 5: system
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` Give the adapter a write side

> It reads an identity today; it must also mint, name and forget one.

1. Add `mint`, `setDisplayName` and `forget` to the port the adapter implements.
2. Write with the modes the plugin already uses: `0600` on the file, `0700` on the directory.
3. Resolve the directory the way `identity.cjs` does — the OS user's own profile, `%APPDATA%` on Windows — and accept no override, because a path a repository or a CI can point at is not a person's own choice.

### `2)` A use-case that owns the choice

> The four verbs, and what each promises.

1. `status` answers one of three states: no identity, an identity with no name, an identity with a name.
2. `on` mints only when none exists; a second `on` is not a new identifier.
3. `name` refuses when nothing was opted into, naming `on` as the missing step.
4. `off` removes the identity and says that new records will carry no person, never that past ones lose theirs.

### `3)` Restore the two suites phase 1 had to move here

> Phase 1 deleted `01-cost`'s reporter, and two suites in
> `scripts/__tests__/aidd-telemetry-identity.test.js` drove `read` through it: *"what a
> default install actually stores, proven from the stored bytes"* and *"a choice made today
> does not reach backwards"*. Reading the stored bytes is a stronger claim than the unit
> tests that currently hold the behaviour, and this is the phase that can restore it.

1. Rebuild both as e2e tests against `aidd telemetry read`, with a journal and a fixture home.
2. Assert from the stored lines themselves, not from a stubbed sink.

### `4)` Wire the subcommand and pin it against the script

> The script is still present in this phase, which is the only chance to compare them.

1. Add `identity` with its four verbs to `telemetry.ts`, wiring only, every failure through `errorHandler.handle`.
2. Drive both `telemetry-identity.cjs <verb>` and `aidd telemetry identity <verb>` against the same temp profile.
3. Assert the resulting identity file is byte-identical and the stated states agree.

## Test acceptance criteria

| Task | Acceptance criteria                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The identity file lands in the OS user's own profile with `0600`/`0700`, and `AIDD_USER_CONFIG_DIR` does not move it.      |
| 2    | A second `on` reports the same identifier as the first; `name` before `on` refuses and names `on`; `off` states that only new records are affected. |
| 3    | A default install stores no person field, proven by reading the lines `aidd telemetry read` wrote; records stored before opting in stay unnamed. |
| 4    | For each of the four verbs, the file the CLI writes is byte-identical to the file the script writes from the same starting state, and an unreadable file surfaces as an error rather than as "no identity". |
