# Instruction: one route — the writing side goes

## Architecture projection

> Corrected post-hoc (review.md, "one route, and every sentence about it true", finding 9):
> the original projection below named 14 of the 22 files this phase actually deleted. The
> other 8 — `enable-tool-telemetry-use-case.ts` and its test, `export-sink-reader.ts` and
> its adapter, `claude-telemetry.ts` and its test, `telemetry-sink.e2e.test.ts`, and
> `telemetry-scope-parsing.unit.test.ts` — went out as correct consequences of the same
> deletion, but a projection that misses a third of what it authorises cannot show what the
> deletion orphans: the file that wrote (and whose sibling could clear) an export
> destination, and the caller that pruned the sink, both went out under a projection that
> named neither. Findings 1 and 4 are what that let escape notice.

journey
  section Setup
    a sink holding one record produced by the removed route, beside records read locally => a machine with both kinds stored: 5: cli
  section Happy path
    report the period => the stored export record is counted, with its own figures: 5: cli
    list the commands the system offers => no command starts a server or writes a destination: 5: cli
    read and report again => the same totals, from the one route that remains: 5: cli
  section Edge case - the removed commands
    a person types a removed command => it is refused as unknown, the way any unknown command is: 1: cli
  section Edge case - nothing listens
    the whole command surface exercised => no port is opened by anything: 1: cli
  section Teardown
    remove the sandboxed profile => nothing left behind: 5: system
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` Delete the writing side

> Three commands, one server, one destination writer, and every test that pinned them.

1. Remove `receive`, `endpoint` and `endpoint clear` from `cli/src/application/commands/telemetry.ts`, with their use cases, the OTLP receiver adapter, the export-config reader and its port, and their tests and fixtures.
2. Unwire all of them from `cli/src/infrastructure/deps.ts`.
3. Narrow each tool's declaration in `cli/src/domain/tools/ai/` and the shape in `cli/src/domain/tools/contracts.ts`: a tool no longer declares an export route, because nothing configures one. Keep `telemetryLocalRead` exactly as it is.
4. Delete the OTLP request fixtures under `cli/tests/fixtures/telemetry-sink/`. They describe a payload nothing parses any more.

### `2)` A stored record still reads

> Removing a way of writing never removes a way of reading. This is the task most at risk of being deleted along with the rest.

1. Keep `provenance` on `TelemetrySinkRecord`, keep `"export"` as one of its values, and keep every rule that reads it: the double-count rules, `withPersonBackfill`, and the per-tool coverage rows.
2. Add `cli/tests/e2e/telemetry-stored-export-record.e2e.test.ts`: seed a sink holding a record produced by the removed route, report the period, and assert it is counted with its own figures.
3. Document at `provenance`'s own declaration that one of its values can no longer be produced by this system and is kept because a stored line outlives the code that wrote it.

### `3)` Prove nothing listens

1. Assert that no source file in `cli/src` creates a server, by the same kind of check the repository already uses to keep source text-only.
2. Make that check name what it protects, so a future listener is a deliberate decision and not an accident.

| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | No command offered by the system starts a server or writes an export destination                    |
| 1    | A removed command is refused as unknown, like any other unknown command                             |
| 1    | Nothing in the source reads or writes a tool's export configuration                                 |
| 2    | A stored record produced by the removed route is still read, counted and reported, with its figures  |
| 2    | The three double-count rules still hold with both kinds of stored record present                     |
| 3    | A check fails if a server is introduced anywhere in the CLI source                                   |
