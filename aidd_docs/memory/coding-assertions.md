# Coding Assertions

The checks that must pass for code to count as done. Minimal, run after every change.

## Before the code

**Write the test first, and watch it fail for the reason it names.** A test written after the
code it covers confirms what was built; only one that failed first can tell you it is
checking anything at all.

Two consequences, both learned by paying for them:

- **A guard ships with the mutation that proves it.** Break the thing the test is named for
  and watch that test — not another — go red. A guard nothing fails for is not a guard, and
  it is indistinguishable from a comment.
- **After any scripted edit, read the file back before running anything.** A replacement
  whose anchor drifted applies to nothing and reports nothing, which is how a field can be
  declared in a type, believed by a display and produced by no code. An inconsistent state is
  worse than a missing feature: nobody designed it, so nobody can reason about it.

Never state in a commit message or a report anything not just observed in output.

## Before commit

| Order | Command | Checks |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 1 | `pnpm exec lefthook run pre-commit` | JSON and YAML validity, skill frontmatter and argument hints, context imports, markdown links, `scripts/` tests; `cli lint` and `cli typecheck` when `cli/` or `kanban/` changed |
| 2 | `pnpm exec commitlint --edit` | the message against `commitlint.config.cjs` |

Same hook regenerates each plugin's `CATALOG.md` and the README counts, and stages them.

## Before push

| Order | Command | Checks |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 1 | `pnpm exec lefthook run pre-push` | `cli knip:production`, then the full `cli` suite, when `cli/` changed |

## Behavior

Done means every gate green. On failure, one agent per failing assertion — typecheck, tests, rules — not one agent for all.
